## General Information
- Application created as part of my sparta global training
- Sort App allow user to create custom size array with random values and compare sorting algorithms performance


## Technologies Used
- SOLID 
- OOP
- Adapter design pattern
- Factory design pattern
- Collections
- Random
- jUnit
- Log4j
- MVC
- Exceptions


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Creating custom size array (maximum 1.000 elements) with random values (1-10.000)
- Option to test performance of each individual algorithm or all algorithms at once 
- CLI (command line user interface )
